# Superstore Sales Analysis (Pivot Table Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Superstore Sales Dataset** using **Google Sheets** to perform pivot-table-based analysis similar to real-world Business Intelligence (BI) reporting. The goal is to summarize sales performance, analyze profitability, and present actionable business insights in a structured and shareable format.

## Analysis Workflow

1. Verified dataset cleanliness (no missing values or inconsistent categories).
2. Structured the data using filters and frozen headers to simulate table behavior.
3. Created a pivot table summarizing **Total Sales by Category** and sorted it in descending order.
4. Built a pivot table showing **Sales by Region and Segment** and applied conditional formatting to highlight top-performing regions.
5. Added slicers for **Region, Category, and Segment** to enable interactive analysis.
6. Created a calculated column **Profit Margin = Profit / Sales** and analyzed it using a pivot table by category and region.
7. Developed a pivot chart to visually compare category-wise sales performance.
8. Derived business insights based on pivot table and chart analysis.
9. Consolidated all pivot tables, charts, and insights into a single report sheet and exported it as a PDF.
